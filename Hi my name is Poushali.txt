Hi my name is Poushali, a lady programmer. In this site I post my Jvascript projects, most of which are implementation of some algorithms, some productivity utilities, which can may be useful to you or some simple memory games. These are fully implemented in vanila js so you need not to be connected to internet once you haveloaded the page. Use my projects and give me feedback about whether you like these or not at my email or social media links.(you can find below). Feel free to suggest me.
